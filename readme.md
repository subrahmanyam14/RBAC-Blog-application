Project Description: Role-Based Access Management for Blogging System
This project is a secure blogging platform built with robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate permissions and access management for different users. The system uses JWT tokens to manage authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific routes and perform allowed actions.

Key Features
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Three Roles:
Admin:
Has complete control over the system.
Can register new Admins and Editors.
Can view all users and their details (excluding passwords).
Has access to all routes and resources.
Editor:
Can read, edit, delete, approve, or reject blogs created by users.
Plays a key role in content moderation.
User:
Can create, edit, and delete their own blogs.
Cannot view or modify other users' blogs or sensitive system data.
2. Authentication & Authorization:
JWT Tokens:
Used for secure authentication.
Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies, which automatically expire based on the token's lifespan, enhancing security.
Middleware-based route protection:
Protects endpoints from unauthorized access.
Enforces role-based restrictions to ensure only permitted users can access specific resources.
3. Password Security:
User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database.
This ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure.
4. Blog Management:
User Functionality:
Can post their own blogs.
Can edit or delete only their own blogs.
Editor Functionality:
Moderates user content by approving or rejecting blogs.
Can edit or delete any blog in the system.
Admin Functionality:
Full control over blogs, users, and editors.
5. Security Enhancements:
Route Middleware:
Protects all routes based on user roles and permissions.
Validates JWT tokens and ensures requests are authorized.
Token Expiry Management:
Tokens automatically expire and are removed from cookies, reducing security risks.
6. Visibility Criteria:
Users can only interact with data they are permitted to access:
Admin can see everything except passwords.
Editor can manage blogs but not user accounts.
Users can only manage their own content.
System Architecture
Backend:

Node.js and Express are used to handle server-side operations.
Middleware layers validate user roles, protect routes, and manage token authentication.
Database:

User credentials and blog data are securely stored in a database.
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring security in case of a breach.
Frontend:

The frontend provides role-specific access and functionality, dynamically adjusting the UI and options available based on the logged-in user's role.

How RBAC is Implemented
Middleware Design:
Authentication middleware verifies the JWT token and identifies the user.
Authorization middleware checks the user's role and enforces access rules.

Advantages of the Project
Secure:

Uses industry-standard practices like JWT and bcrypt to ensure data security.
Tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies, mitigating XSS attacks.
Scalable:

The role-based system allows for easy addition of new roles or permissions in the future.
Flexible:

Role definitions and permissions can be updated without significant architectural changes.
User-Centric:

Provides a seamless experience with tailored functionality based on the user's role.
Compliance:

Protects sensitive data and ensures that only authorized users have access, aligning with modern compliance standards.
